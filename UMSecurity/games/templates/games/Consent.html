      <h2>Consent to Participate in a Research Study</h2>
      <p><b>Title of the Project:</b> Security and decision making</p>
      <p><b>Principal Investigator:</b> Yan Chen, PhD, School of Information, University of Michigan</p>
      <p><b>Co-investigator:</b> Alex Halderman, PhD, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of
    Michigan</p>
      <h3>Invitation to Participate in a Research Study</h3>
      <p>We invite you to be part of a research study about IT security and decision making. The study is funded by the
    University of Michigan.</p>
      <h3>Description of Your Involvement</h3>
      <p>If you agree to be part of the research study, you will be asked to complete a computerized experiment, which
    involves a series of decision making involving lotteries. The experiment will take approximately 20 minutes. At
    the end of the experiment, you will be asked to fill out a short survey on your demographic information and
    work load.</p>
      <h3>Benefits of Participation</h3>
      <p>While you may not receive any direct benefit from your participation, others may ultimately benefit from the
    knowledge obtained in this study.</p>
      <h3>Risks and Discomforts of Participation</h3>
      <p>The experiment does not involve deception of any kind, nor physical discomfort. The study poses no more than
    minimal risk. As each participant might receive different amount of payment depending on his or her decisions
    and those of other participants, some participants might feel frustrated if their payment is below average. To
    minimize this risk, your earnings will be kept private.</p>
      <h3>Compensation for Participation</h3>
      <p>The average payment expected for this experiment is approximately $20, depending on the decisions you and
    other participants make. You will be paid the amount you have earned in a check mailed to your home address.</p>
      <h3>Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>We plan to merge each participantâ€™s employment and personnel information to the research record for our
    aggregate statistical analysis. We will not include any information that would identify you. Your privacy will
    be protected and your research records will be confidential. We plan to publish the aggregate analysis results of
    this study.</p>
      <p>It is possible that other people may need to see the information you give us as part of the study, such as
    organizations responsible for making sure the research is done safely and properly like the University of
    Michigan, and government offices. However, no one will be able to link the data to individual participants.</p>
      <h3>Storage and Future Use of Data</h3>
      <p>We will store your data for five years for record keeping purposes. The data may be shared with investigators
    and research assistants, but will never contain any information that could identify you. However, the
    Institutional Review Board, the sponsor of the study, or university and government officials responsible for
    monitoring this study may inspect these records.</p>
      <h3>Voluntary Nature of the Study</h3>
      <p>Participating in this study is completely voluntary. Even if you decide to participate now, you may change your
    mind and stop at any time. You do not have to answer a question you do not want to answer. Just go to the next
    question. If you decide to withdraw before this study is completed, your data will be kept together with other
    data. You will be compensated for the amount of money you have earned up to the point when you stop.</p>
      <h3>Contact Information for the Study Team</h3>

    participating, you may contact Yan Chen, Ph.D., School of Information, University of Michigan. 734-764-9488,
